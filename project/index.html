            <h2>WITH BENEFITS</h2>
        </header>

        <section class="homepage">
            <p>Indoor plants provide a multitude of benefits, enhancing not only the aesthetics
                but also the overall quality of your living or working space.
                They improve air quality by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen while
                removing toxins, promoting better health and a sense of well-being.
                Indoor plants regulate humidity, reduce stress, and boost focus and productivity,
                making your environment more inviting and soothing.
            </p>
            <p>They also offer mental health
                benefits, serve as natural d√©cor elements, and can absorb background noise.
                Additionally, certain plants can enhance sleep quality and stimulate creativity,
                fostering a stronger connection with nature, while also aiding in temperature
                regulation and air circulation.
            </p>
            <p>To maximise these advantages, it's crucial to
                choose the right plants and provide them with proper care tailored to your
                specific environment.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="more-info">
            <h3>IMPROVED AIR QUALITY AND TEMPERATURE</h3>
            <p>Indoor plants help purify the air by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen 
                through photosynthesis. They also filter out toxins like formaldehyde, benzene, 
                and ammonia, thus enhancing the overall air quality in your space. Many indoor 
                plants release moisture through a process known as transpiration, which can help 
                increase the humidity levels in indoor environments. This is useful during dry 
                winters and hot summer months.
            </p>
        
            <h3>BETTER MENTAL HEALTH</h3>
            <p>Caring for indoor plants can have a positive impact on mental health, reducing 
                symptoms of anxiety and depression. The act of nurturing and tending to plants 
                can be therapeutic and fulfilling. Studies have shown that the presence of indoor 
                plants can reduce stress, lower blood pressure, and promote a sense of well-being.
            </p>

            <h3>ENHANCED FOCUS AND PRODUCTIVITY</h3>
            <p> Indoor plants can improve concentration and productivity by creating a more 
                inviting and pleasant environment. This can lead to a more focused and efficient 
                work or living space.

                <h3>DIRECT LIGHTING</h3>
                <p>Direct lighting is when light exposure where plants receive sunlight that
                    is unobstructed and hits the plant directly without any barriers or diffusing elements. Direct
                    light provides a significant amount of sunlight for an extended period during the day. It
                    is most common during the midday when the sun is at its peak.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section data-lighting="brightIndirect" class="info">
                <h3>BRIGHT INDIRECT LIGHTING</h3>
                <p>Bright indirect light means that the plant receives a significant amount
                    of light but not direct sunlight. It's the level of light you might find near a window
                    where the sun's rays are filtered or diffused by a sheer curtain, blinds, or other
                    obstructions. This provides a well-lit environment without exposing the plant to intense, unfiltered
                    sunlight. Bright indirect light conditions are relatively stable throughout the day, and the
                    plant receives consistent, even illumination.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section data-lighting="mediumIndirect" class="info">
                <h3>MEDIUM INDIRECT LIGHTING</h3>
                <p>Medium indirect light provides a moderate amount of light intensity. It's
                    not as intense as direct sunlight but is brighter than what is considered low light. The
                    light in this category is typically diffuse and even, without direct sun exposure. Plants in
                    medium indirect light receive a consistent and relatively even distribution of light throughout the day.

            <section data-lighting="low" class="info">
                <h3>LOW LIGHTING</h3>
                <p>Low light means that the amount of natural light reaching the plant is
                    significantly reduced compared to bright or direct light. The environment is often dimly
                    lit, and plants in low light may not receive direct sunlight at any point during the
                    day. Low light conditions are often found in areas far from windows or in rooms with small or
                    obstructed windows, such as hallways or bathrooms. The light levels can also be
                    diminished by tall buildings or trees outside the window.

                <h3>GROW LIGHTS</h3>
                <p>Grow lights are used to supplement or replace natural sunlight, especially in indoor environments 
                    where natural light may be limited or inadequate. Grow lights are designed to emit specific wavelengths 
                    of light, including blue and red light, and can be adjusted to provide the appropriate light
                    intensity for plants.

                <p>Sci. name: Alocasia x amazonica</p>
                <p>These plants are appreciated for their striking and unique foliage, making them popular choices for indoor and 
                    outdoor gardens. Alocasia plants thrive in bright, indirect light. Avoid direct sunlight, as it can scorch their 
                    leaves. They can adapt to lower light conditions but may not grow as vigorously.
                </p>
                <p>Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Allow the top inch of the soil to dry out between

                <p>Scientific name: Aloe vera</p>
                <p>Aloe vera is a popular succulent plant known for its medicinal properties and easy care requirements. When 
                    kept indoors, it can thrive with the right care. Aloe vera can tolerate some direct sunlight, but be cautious 
                    of intense afternoon sun, which can scorch the leaves.
                </p>
                <p>Plant your aloe vera in a well-draining potting mix designed for succulents or cacti. Ensure the pot has 
                    drainage holes to prevent waterlogged soil, which can lead to root rot. Aloe vera is drought-tolerant and 
                    prefers to dry out between waterings. Water thoroughly but allow the top 1-2 inches of the soil to dry 
                    out before watering again. The frequency of watering will depend on factors like the season and the 
                    humidity in your home.

                <h3>CACTUS</h3>
                <p>Sci. name: Cactaceae</p>
                <p>Cactus plants are known for their low-maintenance requirements, making them excellent choices for indoor gardening.
                    Cacti thrive in bright, direct sunlight. Place your cactus near a window where it can receive at least 6 hours of 
                    direct sunlight per day. If you don't have access to strong natural light, you can use a grow light to supplement.
                </p>
                <p>Plant your cactus in a well-draining cactus or succulent potting mix. Ensure the pot has drainage holes to prevent 
                    water from pooling at the bottom, which can lead to root rot. Cacti are drought-tolerant and should be allowed to 
                    dry out between waterings. Water sparingly, and only when the top 1-2 inches of soil are completely dry. 
                    Overwatering is one of the most common causes of cactus problems.

                <h3>FIDDLE LEAF FIG</h3>
                <p>Sci. name: Ficus lytara</p>
                <p>Popular indoor plants known for their large, lush, violin-shaped leaves. Fiddle leaf figs require bright, indirect 
                    light to thrive. Place them near a sunny window where they receive plenty of bright, filtered sunlight. Avoid direct 
                    sunlight, as it can scorch the leaves.
                </p>
                <p>Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Water thoroughly and allow the top inch of the soil to dry out 
                    between waterings. Be cautious not to overwater, as it can lead to root rot. Reduce watering during the winter when 
                    growth slows down.

                <h3>MONSTERA DELICIOSA</h3>
                <p>Sci. name: Monstera delciosa</p>
                <p>Often referred to as the Swiss cheese plant, this is a popular and visually striking indoor plant known for its unique 
                    fenestrated (holey) leaves. Your Monstera can grow just about anywhere in your home! It tolerates low light, but grows 
                    faster and becomes more dramatic in a spot with indirect bright light. That said, avoid strong, direct sunlight 
                    because it may burn the leaves. 
                </p>
                <p>Allow the top 1-2 inches of the soil to dry out before watering. Monstera deliciosa prefers to be kept moderately moist 
                    during the growing season (spring and summer) and slightly drier in the winter. Be cautious not to overwater, as this 
                    can lead to root issues.

                <p>Sci. name: Spathiphyllum</p>
                <p>Popular indoor plants known for their elegant white flowers and lush, dark green leaves. Peace lilies prefer bright, 
                    indirect light. They can tolerate low light conditions, but they will thrive in moderate to bright, filtered sunlight. 
                    Avoid placing them in direct sunlight, as it can scorch the leaves.
                </p>
                <p>Peace lilies like to be kept moderately moist, but they do not tolerate sitting in water. Water when the top inch of 
                    the soil feels dry. Be cautious not to overwater. Yellowing leaves can be a sign of overwatering, while drooping 
                    leaves indicate it needs a good drink.

                <p>Sci. name: Phalaenopsis</p>
                <p>Phalaenopsis orchids, often referred to as "Moth Orchids," are popular indoor plants known for their stunning and 
                    long-lasting flowers. These orchids are relatively low-maintenance when provided with the right care. Phalaenopsis 
                    orchids thrive in bright, indirect light. Avoid exposing them to direct, intense sunlight, as it can scorch the leaves.
                    Grow lights are an easy way to supplement the correct lighting for these plants.
                </p>
                <p>Water your orchid carefully. Allow the potting medium to dry out slightly between waterings. Typically, it's best to 
                    water once a week, but this can vary depending on factors such as temperature and humidity. Water thoroughly, and 
                    ensure excess water can drain from the pot.

                <p>Water your Devil's Ivy thoroughly but allow the top inch or two of the soil to dry out between waterings. It's better 
                    to underwater than overwater. Trim or pinch back your Devil's Ivy to encourage bushier growth and prevent it from 
                    becoming too leggy. Pruning is also useful for removing any yellow or damaged leaves.

                <h3>ZANZIBAR GEM</h3>
                <p>Sci. name: Zamioculcas zamiifolia</p>
                <p>Sometimes referred to as the ZZ plant, this popular indoor plant is known for its tolerance to a wide range of indoor conditions and 
                    minimal care requirements. Zanzibar Gems are incredibly adaptable when it comes to light. They can thrive in low to bright, indirect
